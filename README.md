# Build scripts for Dragora GNU/Linux

These scripts are mainly used by me; however, if you need them, here they 
be. Although most of these scripts are available from the Dragora user site, 
I needed to build x86_64 packages for all these programs. Some of the packages, 
those listed below, do not have packages in the user repo and are, therefore, 
made by me.

## The most notable packages are:

* R
* aspell
* aspell-dict
* git
* gnuplot
* graphviz
* nethack
* sbcl
